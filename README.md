# JS-Art-RootBrush

RootBrush

This web app lets you make digital artworks with a somewhat funky styled paintbrush. On strokes, the brush draws by animating root growth, randomizing the direction, length and curvature of each root. You can adjust the density, curvature, length, and color of the roots, and the canvas' background color. Check it out and get creative!

At this stage, the app is written as a tool to leave feedback to a website - likely it will be integrated into the next ETG-series of online exhibitions. Another idea is to integrate it into an upcoming app called 'Letter to Self' that enables you to write a postcard to yourself and receive it by post at any chosen time in the future.

For showcasing, it's attached to the officially offline ETG#1. It allows you to use the animated brush to draw on a square canvas. You may then hit save, add some text and upload your card to a public dashboard where it will be seen by the other visitors.
